WORK LOG

DAY ONE

 have commented out the python placeholder

added first style of css orange-gray theme as i call it
i am keeping flaskapp for now and then remove it if i must
width of the laptop is 1355 px approx

for  i  have a navigation bar of  roughly 500 px
 which makes menu consisting of list of link approx 40 percent of the screen

 although adding percentage disrupts the flow of flex box
 styling with flex provides fluidity
 no need of percentage width and height
 flex box adjusts to any condition

 i should decide on values of flex properties soon enough

keeping header and nav to 100 percent to ensure we get full view
 basic layout is complete for the index percentage

 now i should push it onto my repository


 DAY Two

 working on login.css ad login.html files
 trying out black background and transparent input boxeswith white text color
 separate css files have allocated
 sign in box has been centered
ending it here
